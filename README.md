# PyAlly
A collection of python tools that I've created.
<h2><u>The PyAlly</u></h2>

<p>
Think of this program is a toolbox, it just has a collection of different tools that I use. Instead of carying multiple EXEs on my usb drive, I wanted to condense things, so I created "The PyAlly", and from it, I have access to all the different tools that I want to use.

<b>Here is the collection so far:</b>
</br>[1]: PDF Text Extractor.
</br>[2]: Wordlister. 
</br>[3]: Hacker Helper. 
</br>[4]: Base64 -er.
</br>[5]: CHMOD Helper.
</br>[6]: Image Graber.
</br>[7]: Leeter.

<b>What does each one do?</b>
</br>[1]: PDF Text Extractor.
</br>Give it a PDF file, and it will extract the text, and give you a text file. Does not work with OCR PDFs, yet.

</br>[2]: Wordlister. 
</br>Give it a PDF or a Text file, it will extract the text, remove number, puncuations, and duplicts, and gives you a list of the words in that file. Does not work wiht OCR PDFS, yet.

</br>[3]: Hacker Helper. 
</br>Give it an IP address, it will give you a text file with the common commands (nmap, gobuster, hydra, ect..)that you would use in a CTF, with your IP already inserted, so that you can simply copy and paste the commands into your terminal.

</br>[4]: Base64 -er.
</br>A local, basic standard Encoder and Decoder for Base64.

</br>[5]: CHMOD Helper.
</br>If you need to give permissions to a file, this is a simple interactive guide that will give you the CHMOD code you would need for your file.

</br>[6]: Image Graber.
</br>Inspired by Maria Sha (Python Simplified) Youtube video.
</br>You give it a word, it will go search for that image, and download the first 20 images it finds of your word.

</br>[7]: Leeter.
</br>A simple Leet Sp34k converter, yes it goes both ways. Give it a normal text, it will give you 1337, give it 1337 it will give you normal text.
