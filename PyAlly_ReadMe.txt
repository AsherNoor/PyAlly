<h2><u>The PyAlly</u></h2>

<p>
Think of this program is a toolbox, it just has a collection of different tools that I use. Instead of craying multiple EXEs on my usb drive, I want to condense things, so I create "The PyAlly", and from it, I have access to all the different tools that I want to use.
</p>

</br></br>
<p>
Some updates were made improve some functionality.
</br>+ I'm now using "PDF Plumber" instead of "PyPDF", because it seems to be able to read more difficult PDFs, which is useful for the extraction tool.
</br>+ P.T.E. now has a "Decrypt" option which can make a non-password copy of a password protected PDF. (You must have the password).

<b>Here is the collection so far:</b>
</br>[1]: PDF Text Extractor.
</br>[2]: Wordlister. 
</br>[3]: Hacker Helper. 
</br>[4]: Base64 -er.
</br>[5]: CHMOD Helper.
</br>[6]: Image Graber.
</br>[7]: Leeter.
</p>

<b>What does each one do?</b>
</br>[1]: PDF Text Extractor.
</br>Give it a PDF file, and it will extract the text, and give you a text file. Does not work with OCR PDFs, yet.
</br>This now uses the PDF Plumber library, which allows it work with more difficult PDFs.
</br>It now also has a "Decrypt" option. If you have a password protected PDF, run this program, choose "Decrypt", give it the password, and it will created a non-password PDF copy for you.

</br>[2]: Wordlister. 
</br>Give it a PDF or a Text file, it will extract the text, remove number, puncuations, and duplicts, and gives you a list of the words in that file. Does not work wiht OCR PDFS, yet.
</br>This now uses the PDF Plumber library, which allows it work with more difficult PDFs.

</br>[3]: Hacker Helper. 
</br>Give it an IP address, it will give you a text file with the common commands (nmap, gobuster, hydra, ect..)that you would use in a CTF, with your IP already inserted, so that you can simply copy and paste the commands into your terminal.

</br>[4]: Base64 -er.
</br>A local, basic standard Encoder and Decoder for Base64.

</br>[5]: CHMOD Helper.
</br>If you need to give permissions to a file, this is a simple interactive guide that will give you the CHMOD code you would need for your file.

</br>[6]: Image Graber.
</br>Inspired by Maria Sha (Python Simplified) Youtube video.
</br>You give it a word, it will go search for that image, and download the first 20 images it finds of your word.

</br>[7]: Leeter.
</br>A simple Leet Sp34k converter, yes it goes both ways. Give it a normal text, it will give you 1337, give it 1337 it will give you normal text.

</br><u>Windows:</u> 
</br>You can simply run the PyAlly.exe and your good to go.

</br><u>Linux:</u>
</br>Use your favorite IDE to run the PyAlly.py, and that will run the program for you.

</br>You can also run each the .py of any of the individual programs if you like.
